**Abstract**

This project presents an image forgery detection model using the Xception network, a pre-trained deep learning architecture, to classify images as either forged or original. Grayscale images are processed, resized to fit Xception’s input requirements, and augmented to enhance generalization. Leveraging transfer learning, the model uses Xception as a feature extractor and a custom classification head for binary classification. This approach ensures high accuracy, efficiency, and robustness, making it suitable for applications in image forensics, document verification, and social media monitoring.

**Methodology**
1. **Data Preparation:**  
   Images from the `Forged` and `Original` folders are loaded, converted to grayscale, resized to a uniform size, and normalized to make them suitable for deep learning models.
2. **Data Augmentation:**  
   Techniques like rotating, flipping, zooming, and shifting are applied to the training images to create more diverse data and improve the model’s ability to generalize.
3. **Model Design:**  
   The Xception network, pre-trained on a large dataset (ImageNet), is used as the base model. This network extracts important features from the images. On top of it, a custom set of layers is added to classify the images as forged or original.
4. **Training:**  
   The model is trained using the processed images. Initially, the base model layers are frozen to retain the knowledge from pre-training. After stabilizing the results, fine-tuning can be performed to further improve accuracy.
5. **Evaluation:**  
   The model’s performance is assessed using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. Graphs of training and validation accuracy/loss are used to ensure the model is learning effectively without overfitting.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates that using a pre-trained deep learning model like **Xception** can effectively detect forged images with high accuracy. By leveraging transfer learning and augmenting the data, the model performs well even with limited datasets. It is a reliable approach for applications like detecting fake documents, verifying images in journalism, and identifying tampered photos on social media. With further fine-tuning and more data, the model can be enhanced to tackle even more complex forgery detection tasks.
